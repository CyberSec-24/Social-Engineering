-> Diversion theft is a technique where attackers target delivery professionals or transport companies.

-> This technique is also known as “Round the Corner Game” or “Cornet Game.”

-> The main objective of this technique is to trick a person responsible for making a genuine delivery into delivering the consignment to the wrong location, thus interrupting the transaction.

-> For example, if the victim is a van driver delivering a package, then that person would be persuaded to drive to a location other than the actual delivery location.

-> Diversion theft can also be practiced by social engineers on the Internet; victims can be persuaded to send sensitive or confidential files to some unassociated person who is not intended to receive them.
